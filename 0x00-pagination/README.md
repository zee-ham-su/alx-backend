## Introduction

Pagination is a common technique used in web development to divide large sets of data into smaller, more manageable chunks. It allows users to navigate through the data in a structured and organized manner.

This directory provides examples and implementations of pagination in various programming languages and frameworks.

## Learning Objectives
- At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- How to paginate a dataset with simple page and page_size parameters
- How to paginate a dataset with hypermedia metadata
- How to paginate in a deletion-resilient manner

## Requirements
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.*)
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
